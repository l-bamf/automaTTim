## Premise
Arnotts is currently running a promotional campaign
wherein three specially marked TimTam packets contain a little lamp worth one wish ($100,000), ala Aladdin.
You may, like me, better associate this marketing strategy with a franchise 
unrelated to genies but this section of the promotion can be ignored just like Johnny Depp's version.

The more important competition and the one this tool is built to exploit is a giveaway of $100 hourly to
anyone who fills out an online application in the previous hour. 
This occurs every hour of the day, **including late at night**. 
So, the simple calculation is that few enough people will apply during these hours to make the price of
a packet a greater than break-even investment. 
The magic number for the hour is either 25 entrants for full price ($4) or 50 for half price ($2).
Profit is the goal, but increasing my odds means in the worst case a packet is nicely subsidised.
Since the campaign is only is Australia and New Zealand, it's plausible that during a couple of hours
the participation will drop below this number.

Of course, I don't actually want to apply during those hours (hopefully nobody does) so the goal of this project is 
to have a computer do it while I sleep.
